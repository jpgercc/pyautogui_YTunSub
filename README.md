This is a potato code to Unsibricre from all YouTube channels on your account.
---
It is not a scalable application, it only works on my screen, so you will need to change the values, the test.py class should help you with this.

HOW TO USE IT:
<ol>
  <li>
    Download pyautogui
  </li>
  <li>
    Open <a href='https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels'>this web page</a> (logged on your account, obviously)
  </li>
</ol>

<b>BEWARE!</b>: The code has no break and will run forever.
