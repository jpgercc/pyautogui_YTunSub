This is a potato code to Unsibricre from all YouTube channels on your account.
---
It is not a scalable application, it only works on my screen, so you will need to change the values, the <a href='https://github.com/jpgercc/pyautogui_YTunSub/blob/main/test.py'>test.py </a> class should help you with this.

REQUIREMENTS:
<ul>
  <li>
    Python 3
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href='https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/'> PyAutoGUI API </a>
  </li>
</ul>

HOW TO USE IT:
<ol>
  <li>
    Open <a href='https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels'>this web page</a> (logged on your account, obviously)
  </li>
  <li>
    Run main.py
  </li>
  <li>
    Press ALT + TAB (You have a 1 second interval for this, then the program will start working.)
  </li>
</ol>
